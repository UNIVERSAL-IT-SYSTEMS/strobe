       _s_t_r_o_b_e   is  a  network/security  tool  that  locates  and
       describes all listening tcp ports on a (remote) host or on
       many hosts in a bandwidth utilisation maximising, and pro-
       cess resource minimising manner.

       _s_t_r_o_b_e approximates a parallel finite state machine inter-
       nally. In non-linear multi-host mode it attempts to appor-
       tion bandwidth and sockets  among  the  hosts  very  effi-
       ciently.   This  can  reap  appreciable gains in speed for
       multiple distinct hosts/routes.

       On a machine with a reasonable number of  sockets,  _s_t_r_o_b_e
       is  fast  enough to port scan entire Internet sub domains.
       It is even possible to survey an entire small country in a
       reasonable  time  from a fast machine on the network back-
       bone, provided the machine in question uses dynamic socket
       allocation   or  has  had  its  static  socket  allocation
       increased very appreciably (check your kernel options). In
       this  very limited application _s_t_r_o_b_e is said to be faster
       than IISSSS22..11 (a high quality commercial security scanner by
       cklaus@iss.net and friends) or PPiinnggWWaarree (also commercial).

       --vv     Verbose output.

       --VV     Verbose statistical output.

       --mm     Minimise output. Only print hostname, port  tuples.
              Implies --dd.  Useful for automated output parsing.

       --dd     Delete duplicate entries for port descriptions. i.e
              use only the first definition.

       --gg     Disable usage of ggeettppeeeerrnnaammee(2).   On  ssoollaarriiss  2.3
              machines  this  causes  a  core  dump,  for reasons
              unknown. This behaviour is fixed with ssoollaarriiss  2.4.
              Under  Linux, HP and perhaps other unix implementa-
              tions, false tcp  connection  positives  may  occur
              when this option is activated.

       --ss     Statistical  information  describing the average of
              all hosts surveyed is sent to stderr on completion.

       --qq     Quiet mode. Don't print non-fatal errors or the (c)
              message.

              services entry file (Cf.  --BB).

       --oo ffiillee
              Direct  output  (but  not any messages which can be
              affected by --qq) to file.

       --bb nnuummbbeerr
              Beginning (starting) port number.

       --ee nnuummbbeerr
              Ending port number.

       --pp nnuummbbeerr
              Port number if you intend to scan a single port.

       --PP nnuummbbeerr
              Local port to bind outgoing connection requests to.
              (you  will  normally  need super-user privileges to
              bind ports smaller than 1024)

       --AA aaddddrreessss
              Interface  address  to  send  outgoing   connection
              requests from for multi-homed machines.

       --tt nnuummbbeerr
              Time  after  which  a  connection attempt to a com-
              pletely unresponsive host/port is aborted.

       --nn nnuummbbeerr
              Use this number of sockets in parallel (defaults to
              64).   _s_t_r_o_b_e  attempts  to figure out if nnuummbbeerr is
              greater than the quantity of available  sockets  at
              any point in time -- and if so, only use the amount
              found.  On  some  UNIX  implementations   such   as
              Solaris, this appears not to work correctly and you
              may find yourself with unusual errors  such  as  NNOO
              RROOUUTTEE  TTOO  HHOOSSTT  when  you  hit the socket ceiling.
              Remember that _s_t_r_o_b_e probably isn't the  only  pro-
              cess on the system desiring a socket or two. Having
              _s_t_r_o_b_e pilfer  all  the  spare  sockets  away  from
              iinneettdd(8) and other daemons and clients isn't such a
              crash hot idea, unless you want  to  stop  all  new
              incoming and outgoing connections.

       --SS ffiillee
              Change  the  default port services description file
              to ffiillee.  Note that if --SS  is  not  specified  port
              services  are  loaded  from one of ssttrroobbee..sseerrvviicceess,
              //uussrr//llooccaall//lliibb//ssttrroobbee..sseerrvviicceess, or //eettcc//sseerrvviicceess.

       --ii ffiillee
              Obtain hostnames to strobe from  ffiillee  rather  than
              from  the  command  line.  Note that only the first
              white-space separated word in each line of ffiillee  is



                                                                2

              used,  so one can feed in files such as //eettcc//hhoossttss.
              If filename is ''--'' , stdin will be used.

       --ll     Probe hosts linearly (sequentially) rather than  in
              parallel.  The  actual ports on each host are still
              checked in a parallel manner (with a parallelism of
              --nn (defaults to 64)).

       --ff     Fast mode, probe only the tcp ports detailed in the
              port services file (see --SS).

       --aa nnuummbbeerr
              Abort and skip to the next host after ports upto to
              nnuummbbeerr  have  been  probed and still no connections
              have occurred. Due to the parallel  nature  of  the
              probing,  reply  packets  for n+m may return before
              those relating to n. What this means is that  ports
              >  nnuummbbeerr  may be probed. If _s_t_r_o_b_e see's a connec-
              tion on any one of these higher  ports  before  its
              negated  all  possibility of a service listening on
              ports <= nnuummbbeerr then  despite  the  fact  that  all
              ports up to and including nnuummbbeerr may turn out to be
              connectionless, _s_t_r_o_b_e will `abort the abort'. This
              is considered optimal, if unusual behaviour.

       --MM     Mail  a  bug report, or tcp/udp port description to
              the current source maintainer.

       _s_t_r_o_b_e  all  entries in //eettcc//hhoossttss (identical ip addresses
       are skipped automagically) using 120 sockets in  parallel,
       but  only check the individual tcp ports mentioned in sseerr--
       vviicceess.  If we have probed up to port 80 on a host and have
       still not yet evidenced a connection, then skip that host.
       Display speed/time statistics for each host  and  for  the
       totality  of  hosts to stderr. Place the regular output in
       oouutt.

       ypcat hosts | strobe -p 80 -t 2 -A 203.4.184.1 -P 53

       _s_t_r_o_b_e all hosts  in  your  hosts  YP/NIS-table  for  WWW-
       servers.  Use  a  timeout  of two seconds.  Set the source
       address to the 203.4.184.1 interface. Make all  connection
       requests appear to come from port 53 (DNS).


BBUUGGSS
       _S_t_r_o_b_e performs no other security functions (yet) and does
       not verify route blocking against  UDP  or  TCP  handshake
       sequence guessing one-way IP spoofing attacks.
